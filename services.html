                <H3>Translation: </H3>
                I translate from Spanish to English and from Italian to English, in general working with unboring texts whose writing is more art than technique. I try to make writing sing and ideas dance as suggestively in their English translation as they do in the author’s original.  I carry a deep respect for the writer, and I work hard to ferry her original voice and spirit into my translation. I’m especially good at writing for academic publication (journal articles as well as books) in the humanities and social sciences, but I can adjust my style and argument to the demands of most disciplines. 
                
                <H3>Editing and revision: </H3>
                Everyone can write, but not everyone can write <i>well</i>. I can help with that. 
                
                <H3> Critical review:</H3>
                I can edit <i>technically</i>, sure, but where I add something special is in developmental editing. If you have a grant proposal, journal article, book, or dissertation that you’re preparing to submit and would like a review of – and maybe a hand with – its content, maybe I can help. I have first-authored four publications in major international journals and have written and contributed to more in less austere media; I’ve been there and done that with Master’s and Ph.D. dissertations; and I’ve successfully presented proposals for two major international awards (a Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Fellowship and a European Union Marie Curie Fellowship) to fund my postgraduate study and research. I’ll do my best to make critical, constructive recommendations that will help you make <i>your</i> projects as good as they can be.

                I’m a good thinker. More than anything else, I’m critical. If you wonder where your argument might have a weak spot, ask me; if you fear that you haven’t addressed important counterarguments, ask me; if you worry what your boss or advisor will say, ask me. 
                
                Given my recent career trajectory in the critical humanities and social sciences, it might come as a surprise to know that my first degree and career were in mechanical/aerospace engineering. While I like words, I also know numbers, and I know how to crunch them.

                    I worked for two years as an admissions counselor at the University of Notre Dame, a top-ranked university in the USA. I made admissions decision and understand what university admissions officers are “looking for.” I’ve also worked as a reviewer for postgraduate grant proposals. If you’d like feedback on your application, ask. 

                    I’ve also served as a peer reviewer for several major international academic journals. If you’d like a critique of your article before you submit it, ask. 
                    
                    And if you need to evaluate candidates or proposals for a project you’re organizing, I can do that, too:  
                    <i>ask</i>.
