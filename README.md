TO DO: 
1. Figure out why LinkedIn link won't render but its bitly substitute well. Try subbing it in and out again? 
2. Introduce a media query and ... what else ?? ... to make it more responsive to small screens. (e.g. in the Partners Bar, I have four columns ... tell it: For small screens, use only two columns, and then move to the next row.) 


SUBSTANTIVE ADDS: 
1. Add "the People" ... with their self-given blurbs and links.

Learned: 
1. Case sensitive file names. >> I will use always lowercase file names from now on. 
2. Figure out how to vertically center the main-area on the page (and the image in it, in the case of index.html)
